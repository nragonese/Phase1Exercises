14.2.5 Exercises

1) paste0 automatically assumes you're using "" as the seperator. as.character is the same function. paste coerces NA characters

2) collapse puts them into a single string with quotes around all parts of the string. Sep puts them as separate strings with quotes around each.

3)  string1 <- "string"
str_length(string1) #6
str_sub(string1,3,4)

you have to either take both, pick one, or do a mean function

4) determines how many characters until the text should wrap. Could be useful for lists and other formatting.

5) removes blank characters before or after the string. Str_pad is the opposite.

1) \ is just saying escape but nothing to escape. \\ just says escape the backslash, but then has nothing to look for. I didn't follow the logic of why you need 4 blackslashes instead of 3.

2) str_view(x, "\"\'\\\\")

3) .[any character].[any character].[any character]
