### Exercises 28.3.1

1)
corners <- tibble(x = c(0,1),
                  y = c(0,1))
ggplot(corners, aes(x,y)) +
    geom_text(label = "bot_right", x = Inf, y = -Inf) +
    geom_text(label = "top_right", x = Inf, y = Inf) +
    geom_text(label = "bot_left", x = -Inf, y = -Inf) +
    geom_text(label = "top_left", x = -Inf, y = Inf)
    
2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
    geom_point() +
    annotate("text",x = 6, y = 40, label = "label")
    
3)
mpg2 <- mpg %>% group_by(cyl) %>% mutate(avg_cty = round(mean(cty),1))
ggplot(data = mpg2, aes(cty, hwy)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_text(aes(label = avg_cty), y = 45, x = 10) +
    facet_grid(~cyl)

It automatically applies to all facets, I tried for an hour but couldn't get it to filter for a specific facet.

4)
use fill as a way to control the background box:

mpg2 <- mpg %>% group_by(cyl) %>% mutate(avg_cty = round(mean(cty),1))
ggplot(data = mpg2, aes(cty, hwy)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_text(aes(label = avg_cty), y = 45, x = 10) +
    geom_label(data = mpg2, aes(label = avg_cty, fill = as.factor(cyl), y = 45, x = 10))+
    facet_grid(~cyl)
