### Exercises 28.3.1

1)
corners <- tibble(x = c(0,1),
                  y = c(0,1))
ggplot(corners, aes(x,y)) +
    geom_text(label = "bot_right", x = Inf, y = -Inf) +
    geom_text(label = "top_right", x = Inf, y = Inf) +
    geom_text(label = "bot_left", x = -Inf, y = -Inf) +
    geom_text(label = "top_left", x = -Inf, y = Inf)
    
2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
    geom_point() +
    annotate("text",x = 6, y = 40, label = "label")
    
3)
mpg2 <- mpg %>% group_by(cyl) %>% mutate(avg_cty = round(mean(cty),1))
ggplot(data = mpg2, aes(cty, hwy)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_text(aes(label = avg_cty), y = 45, x = 10) +
    facet_grid(~cyl)

It automatically applies to all facets, I tried for an hour but couldn't get it to filter for a specific facet.

4)
use fill as a way to control the background box:

mpg2 <- mpg %>% group_by(cyl) %>% mutate(avg_cty = round(mean(cty),1))
ggplot(data = mpg2, aes(cty, hwy)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_text(aes(label = avg_cty), y = 45, x = 10) +
    geom_label(data = mpg2, aes(label = avg_cty, fill = as.factor(cyl), y = 45, x = 10))+
    facet_grid(~cyl)
    
5) angle, length, ends, type

### Exercises 28.4.4

1)
?geom_hex() says it is mapping the number to the hexagon fill, so below is the correct function:
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
    geom_hex() +
    scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "red") +
    coord_fixed()
    
2) an argument on how the continuous variables should be mapped. this varies from labs() where discrete variables are defined.
 
3)presidential %>%
  mutate(id = 33 + row_number()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(start, id, colour = party)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = end, yend = id)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c(Republican = "red", Democratic = "blue")) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(34, 44, by = 1), labels = presidential$name) +
  labs(x = "year", y = "President", title = "Presidentail Terms") +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "4 years", date_labels = "%y")
  
4)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
    geom_point(aes(colour = cut), alpha = 1/20) +
    guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Quality",override.aes = list(alpha = 1, shape = 1, size = 4)))
