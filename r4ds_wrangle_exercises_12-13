12.2.1 Exercises

1) Table 1: each column indicates a variable defined by the header. each row is a unique observaton. 
table 2 : country and year each have their own column, but the type column contains contains multiple variables.
table 3: country and year still have their own columns and although there's only one column for rate, it would be more useful if rate were broken up into it's two components.
talbe 4: the two variables are in two different tables. the variable year is also broken out amongst two columns.

2)
cases <- filter(table2, type == "cases")

population <- filter(table2, type == "population")

new<- join(cases,popoulation, type = "left", match = "all")

mutate(rate = cases / population * 10000)

4a and 4b are easier in this case because they already have the step of creating 2 seperate tables with cases and populaton.

3) same start as to 2) then plot the data:

ggplot(new, aes(year, cases)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country), colour = "grey50") + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = country))

12.3.3 Exercises

1) when you spread, you've created new variables with each of the years.

2) need brackets around the dates.

3) There's two different ages for Phillip Woods. We need a way to uniquely identify them.

4) gather(preg,"male","female",key = "sex",value = "age")
